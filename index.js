// Sample code (simplified for illustration)

// Step 1: Initialize the Game
let deck = [...Array(52).keys()]; // Representing cards as numbers for simplicity
shuffleDeck(deck);

// Step 2: Deal Cards
let player1Cards = dealCards(deck);
let player2Cards = dealCards(deck);

// Step 3: Place Bets (Assuming players always bet)

// Step 4: Draw a Card
let drawnCard = drawCard(deck);

// Step 5: Evaluate Bets
if (isBetween(drawnCard, player1Cards)) {
    // Player 1 wins the bet
    // Update scores or perform other actions
} else if (isBetween(drawnCard, player2Cards)) {
    // Player 2 wins the bet
    // Update scores or perform other actions
} else {
    // Nobody wins this round
}

// Repeat steps 3-5 for additional rounds
